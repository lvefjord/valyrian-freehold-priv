 vf_bm_7888_desc:0 "For thousands of years, the Valyrian Freehold has stood as the greatest power in the known world. Now, twelve years before the Doom, the might of Valyria is unrivaled. Forty proud families riding dragons of fire and blood, form the pillars of this great civilization. From these lineages, the dragonlords elects their Archons — provincial rulers of the Freehold's territories that wield the collective power of their peers.\n\nThe wealth of the known world pours into the Dragonlords' vaults, and the skies above Valyria darken with the wings of dragons beyond count. Yet, even as the Freehold stands at the zenith of its glory, whispers of discontent and ambition grow in the shadows of its topless towers. For the greatest threat to the Freehold has never come from beyond, but from within.\n\n#bold Will you guide the Freehold to even greater heights, or will you be the one to bring about its downfall?#!"

 bookmark_vf_aenar_desc:0 "Two years ago, Aenar's daughter Daenys 'the Dreamer' had a prophectic dream that foretold of a great cataclysm that would leave Valyria in ruins. Fearing for the safety of all she held dear, Daenys convinced her father to leave — lest they be consumed by the fury of the fourteen flames. Aenar then sold his holdings in Valyria and moved his family and wealth to the westernmost outpost of the Freehold: the island of Dragonstone.\n\n#bold Will Aenar continue playing the political game of the Dragonlords, or will he look to the west for a new beginning?#!"

 bookmark_vf_toparchon:0 "Archon Aurion"
 bookmark_vf_toparchon_desc:0 "As the provincial ruler of the Lands of the Long Summer, Aurion is one of the most powerful Dragonlords in the Freehold. An ambitious man, he would years later go on to survive the Doom and declare himself the first Emperor of Valyria. His reign would be short-lived however, for he and his host would soon vanish into the smoking ruins of Valyria — never to be seen again.\n\n#bold Will Aurion's ambition lead him to greatness, or is he destined to be consumed by the flames of his own hubris?#!"

 bookmark_vf_middlearchon_desc:0 "A learned man, Jaehaelor stands apart from his peers as a scholar and avid gardener — a simple passion that would prove fortuitous, as he was in the forests of Qohor collecting samples for his gardens when the Doom fell on Valyria. As an Archon he is respected by his fellow dragonlords, but his lack of ambition and kinder disposition have lead some to wonder how he ever rose to such a position in the first place.\n\n#bold Will Jaehaelor's wisdom guide the Freehold to a brighter future, or will his lack of ambition be his undoing?#!"
